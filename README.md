 3. Fill out the info in *config.js*
 4. Run `npm install` to fetch dependencies

 - Bot messages in *strings.json*

## Misc

This bot is not official supported. Do not complain about how horribly it is written or ask me for support. Updates/fixes are not guaranteed and will only be provided if I am in a good mood and I have some spare time.
